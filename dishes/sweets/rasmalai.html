        <li>Boil 1 liter of milk. Once it comes to a boil, add lemon juice or vinegar to curdle it. Strain using a muslin cloth and wash with water. Hang for 30–45 minutes to remove excess water.</li>
        <li>Knead the chenna until smooth. Make small, flat discs (rasgullas). Ensure there are no cracks for a soft texture.</li>
        <li>Boil water with sugar to make a light syrup. Add the rasgulla discs and cook for 15–20 minutes until they double in size. Let them cool.</li>
        <li>Boil 1 liter of milk and simmer until it reduces to half. Add sugar, cardamom powder, saffron strands, and chopped nuts like pistachios and almonds.</li>
        <li>Gently squeeze the cooked rasgullas to remove syrup, then place them in the rabri. Let them soak and absorb the flavor for a few hours.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate rasmalai for a few hours. Garnish with more nuts and saffron. Serve chilled for a rich, creamy Bengali dessert experience.</li>
