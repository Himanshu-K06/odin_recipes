    <h3><em>Description:</em></h3>
    <p>Shahi Paneer is a royal Mughlai curry made with soft paneer cubes simmered in a creamy, rich gravy of tomatoes, onions, nuts, and spices. Mildly sweet and fragrant, it’s a luxurious vegetarian delight served with naan or rice.</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>
    <p>Paneer, onions, tomato purée, ginger-garlic paste, cashews, fresh cream, milk, ghee or oil, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, salt, saffron strands (optional), fresh coriander or cream for garnish.</p>
    <h3><em>Steps:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan, heat ghee or oil. Sauté chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, and cashews until soft. Let it cool, then blend into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add a little more ghee. Pour in the paste and cook until it thickens. Add tomato purée and cook until oil separates.</li>
        <li>Mix in turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Stir well and cook for a few minutes to release flavors.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and add fresh cream and a little milk. Stir continuously to get a rich, smooth, royal gravy.</li>
        <li>Gently add paneer cubes. Simmer for 5–7 minutes so the paneer absorbs the flavors without breaking.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped coriander or a swirl of cream. Serve hot with naan, roti, or jeera rice. A rich, royal North Indian delight!</li>
