        <li>In a bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to enhance flavor.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a pan. Saut√© sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnish and blend the rest into a paste with soaked cashews or almonds.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add whole spices (cardamom, cloves, bay leaf), then the onion-nut paste. Cook well, then add coriander powder, garam masala, and a little water.</li>
        <li>Add marinated chicken to the masala. Cook on medium heat until the chicken is browned and sealed with the spice mix.</li>
        <li>Add more yogurt and a bit of cream or milk. Cover and simmer on low heat until the chicken is tender and the gravy turns rich and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Top with fried onions and chopped coriander. Serve hot with naan, paratha, or rice for a rich, Mughlai-style meal.</li>
